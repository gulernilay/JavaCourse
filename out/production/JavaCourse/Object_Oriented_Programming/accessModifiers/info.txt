Modifiers: They are used to control access mechanisms and also provide information about class functionalities to JVM. They are divided into two categories namely:

           Access modifiers (private, default , protected ,public)
           Non-access modifiers(transient,native,final ,static, abstract ,synchronized,volatile) :In java, we have 7 non-access modifiers. They are used with classes, methods, variables, constructors, etc to provide information about their behavior to JVM.
