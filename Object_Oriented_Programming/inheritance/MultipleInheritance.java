Multiple Inheritance is a feature of an object-oriented concept, where a class can inherit properties of more than one parent class.
The problem occurs when there exist methods with the same signature in both the superclasses and subclass.
 On calling the method, the compiler cannot determine which class method to be called and even on calling which class method gets the priority.
Note: Java doesnâ€™t support Multiple Inheritance
